# node-jasmine-phantomjs
> PhantomJS Runner for Jasmine 1.x

The jasmine-phantomjs module provides the `jasmine-phantomjs.js` script and extensions to drive PhantomJS to enable testing your specs within a browser with Jasmine from the console. The preferred usage is to install `mocha-phantomjs` via node's packaged modules and use the `mocha-phantomjs` binary wrapper.

[Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) is a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on node and the browser. [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org) is a headless WebKit with a Javascript API. It has fast and native support for various web standards like DOM handling, CSS selectors, JSON, Canvas, and SVG.
